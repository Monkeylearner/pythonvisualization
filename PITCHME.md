### Outline

** Intro (plot anatomy, types of plots, matplotlib organization)
** Simple examples
** Styling elements
** Plotting with pandas dataframes
** Pretty plots (Seaborn)

---
### Object Oriented Interface

* Matplotlib plots have two primary classes - Figures and Axes
* Preferred plotting approach is:
  1. Create figure and axis instances w/ plt.subplots
  2. Use figure and axis methods to modify visual elements

---

### Basic matplotlib syntax
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot(x,y, ***kwargs)
fig.savefig('path/to/file.png')
```
@[3] Create figure and axis objects
@[4] Most plotting functions exist as Axes methods
@[5] Figure methods control axes layout and saving
